# habit-tracker

### disclaimer
this code was my first ever experience with programming (I was 13 or so). I believe it has some value, either the idea or just maybe it can inspire other 13yo begginers to code. 

## Description
Desktop app created in Java for the purpose of tracking daily activities.
App contains a variety of different activities such as 'cleaning my room' or 'doing homework' and these activities are evaluated with points from one to five. The user interface consists of several drop-down menus having the activities as a choice. When selected, the points are added to the user's daily score.
